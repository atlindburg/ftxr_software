# Monochromatic Beam Interference Simulation

## Overview
This Python script simulates the interference of a monochromatic light beam, with a wavelength of 633 nm. It computes the average intensity of the interference as a function of time delay between two electric fields. Additionally, the script performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the computed intensities to analyze the frequency spectrum and visualizes the results.

## Requirements
To run the script, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`

You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
